## Profile Page
  - This is my profile page to share with others in a single pane of glass.
    - A few big goals I wanted to accomplish with this: 
      - My first presentable draft will consist of ONLY vanilla HTML and CSS (as a challenge to myself and my creative energies). 
      - I'd like to make this full stack at some point (I mean I do want to be a full stack developer at some point...)
      - Single pane of glass means no scrolling. I want to challenge myself to come up with a way to display everything a profile needs to in a single page. 


## Brainstorming
  - Possible toggle between 2 structure ideas (screenshot)
    - center and resize images to match (project & resume; socials middle of those two)
  - Color of the AboutMe background text (will depend on position on the image)
  - Expand upon the Projects section to have description of each/stack used/etc.
    - Popup vs Flat text?
  - !! Mobile & tablet responsiveness !!
