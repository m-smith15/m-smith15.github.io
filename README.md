This will be a profile that I can share. Hopefully it will be an expansion of my GitHub profile's README. 


## Brainstorming
  - Possible toggle between 2 structure ideas (screenshot)
    - center and resize images to match (project & resume; socials middle of those two)
  - Color of the AboutMe background text (will depend on position on the image)
  - Expand upon the Projects section to have description of each/stack used/etc.
    - Popup vs Flat text?
